# PONG GAME

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's turtle graphics module and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

Player A uses the ‘w’ and ‘s’ keys to move their paddle up and down.

Player B uses the ‘Up’ and ‘Down’ arrow keys to move their paddle up and down.

The ball moves automatically, bouncing off paddles and the top and bottom of the screen.

Each time a player misses the ball, the other player scores a point.
